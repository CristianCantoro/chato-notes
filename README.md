# ChaTo-notes
A LaTeX package for notes / todos / questions / answers.

[Matteo](http://matteo.rionda.to) got this package from [Aris
Anagnostopoulos](http://aris.me/), which in turn must have received it from
[Carlos "ChaTo" Castillo](http://chato.cl/) (based on comments in the original
file), hence the name. According to a note in the package file, Aris modified it.
Matteo modified it further.

It came to Matteo with no license, and he is releasing it under the
[Apache License 2.0](./LICENSE) (see also the [NOTICE](./NOTICE) file).
If Aris and/or ChaTo prefer a different license, they know how to get in touch
with Matteo.
